    CSS libraries such as bootstrap, Material UI, Tailwind, or Bulma are CSS libraries that make life easier for 
web developers. All of these give a framework for css so people can create and design websites in a shorter amount
of time since the outline is already given to them. So instead of creating and designing a website from the 
ground up, people can use these CSS libraries to start instead. When using these CSS libraries, it can come with 
an HTML, CSS, and JS folders. Developers like using CSS libraries because there are so many to choose from,
and they can also be similar in design so the website design can look more put together. For example, on Bootstrap,
developers can choose from a range of layouts, themes, buttons, drop down menus, etc. The only thing developers 
would need to do if using bootstrap is add their html with the css file and edit some stuff so that it can work 
together and they already have a basically done website. 
    Another way CSS libraries can be used is to cut down on excessive CSS coding. With these libraries, it can 
help you create websites and cut down on too many classes or ids. There are also usually many updates and 
a huge community of people using these so you can ask for help within the community if you need help with 
troubleshooting. In addition, these CSS libraries can also have the layouts that will also be able to adjust itself
to whatever device you are viewing the site on. For example, it can convert itself to a mobile page, desktop page,
tablet page, etc. This can cut a lot of time out of coding. To use these frameworks, simply use the CSS, HTML, or JS 
file that they provide you with and edit it accordingly. With this, you can create better website in less time!
